//                                                  THEORETICAL CONCEPT

EULER PATH :- IT IS A PATH IN A GRAPH THAT VISITS EVERY EDGE EXACTLY ONCE. WE DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT UNVISITED VERTEX.
EULER CIRCUIT :- EULER PATH WITH SMAE START AND END POINT.

IT IS AN EULER CIRCUIT THEN YOU START FROM ANY POINT YOU WILL DEFINITELY GET AN EULER PATH.


//                                                  ALGORITHMIC INTUAUTION FOR EULER CIRCUIT

1. INDEGREE SHOULD BE EVEN FOR EVERY VERTEX I MEAN KI EK JANE KE LIYE AUR 1 ANE KE LIYE TO HONA CHAIYE NA , NAHI TO CONFUSION HO JAYEGA
    KI KON SE RASTE SE JAYE AUR KON SE AYE AUR CHALE BHI GAYE TO EK PATH TO HONA HI CHAIYE NA ANE KE LIYE , THATS WHY EVEN 
2. I AM ABLE TO VISIT EVERY EDHES IN A CONTINOUS WAY I MEAN LETS SAY WITHOUT LIFITING THE PEN.
    YOU CAN ALSO SAY ALL THE VERTEX SHOULD BE  CONNECTED AKA NOT DISCRETE GRAPH
    ALL VERTEX SHOULD BE PART OF A SINGLE COMPONENT
    ** ALL NON ZERO DEGREE VERTEX/NODES SHOULD BE CONNECTED.

NOTE --- FOR DIRECTED GRAPH WE WILL CHECK THAT INDEGREE == OUTDEGREE. REST SAME


//                                                  ALGORITHMIC INTUAUTION FOR EULER PATH

1. EXACTLY ZERO OR TWO NODES CAN HAVE  ODD INDEGREE AND REMAINING SHOULD HAVE EVEN INDEGREE
2. SHOULD BE A SINGLE COMPONENT 

//                                                      CODE PART

1. FIND INDEGREE FOR ALL VERTEX
2. APPLY DFS OPERATION
3. CHECK THAT ALL NON-ZERO INDEGREE VERTEX IS VISITED
4. IF ALL ARE THEN IT IS AN EULER CIRCUIT ELSE NOT.


// THERE IS A HAMILTON CYCLE CONCEPT WHICH SAYS E SHOULD VISIT EACH VERTEX EXACTLY ONCE .
