MULTISOURCE SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM
HAR EK NODE SE HAR EK NODE KA SHORTEST PATH
USE ONLY FOR DIRECTED GRAPHS , WEIGHTS CAN BE POSITUVE OR NEGATIVE
IF YOU CAN REACH SOMEWHERE THROUGH ANOTHER NODE TAKE A HINT FOR THIS ALGO , AKA INDIRECT CONNECTION USE FLOYD WARSHAL

WARSHAL CHECKS FOR TARNSITIVE IN TGHE NODES AND FLOYD UPDATE SIT WITH MIN DISTANCE.



//                                             FLOYD WARSHAL ALGORITHM

 select each node as an intermediate node and visit each node throuch the intermedite node
// while visiteng update the distanmce with the min distance
// order of selecting the intermediate node does not matter
// its not important that therese is only 1 node between i and j there can be many nodes from i to intermediate node and then from intermediate
//      node to the final node

IF DIAGONAL ELEMENTS ARE NEGATIVE THEN THERE IS NEGATIVE CYCLE PRESENT IN THE GRAPH

//                                                                  CODE PART


if there is no connection betwwen 2 nodes then tjat is represented as int_max in our logic

for(int k = 0 ; k < n ; k++) {
    for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) {
        for(int j = 0 ; j < n ; j++) {
            if(mat[i][k] != INT_MAX and mat[k][j] != INT_MAX) {
                mat[i][j] = min(mat[i][j] , mat[i][k] + mat[k][j]) ;
            }
        }
    }
}


TIME COMPLEXITY = O(N^3) 
SPACE COMPLEXITY = O(1)



//                                                      IMPORTANT


IF DENSE GRAPH THE TC FOR DIJISTRA IS V^3 AND FOR SPARSE IT IS V^2LOGV IF WE HAVE TO FIND MULTISOURCE SHORTEST PATH
EXPLAIN WHY I AM CHOIOING BETWEEN DIJISTRA AND FLOYD WARSHAL IN INTERVIEW FOR EXTRA MARKS
AND ALSO DIJISTRA IS ONLY FOR POSITUVE WEIGHTS

NOW FOR BELLMAN FORD ITS TC IS ALSO V^4 FOR MULTISOURCE PATH WHEN COMPLETE GRAPH
