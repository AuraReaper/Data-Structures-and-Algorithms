** rotation By 90 degrees clockwise **

Method 1 : We can create a 2D Vector and fill it likewise ans[j][n-1-i] for clockwise rotation 

Method 2 : find transpose of matrix and then reverse row using 2 pointers

** Rotation By 180 degrees clockwise **

Swap the rows from up to down using 2 pointers by matrix[start][j] , matrix[end][j] 
and then reverse each column using 2 pointers 
....
aka uoar wale ko niche lana hai and then right wala ko left lana hai using 2 pointers.


Note : The trick here in solvingb these question are 2 you will see we swap rows or columns , transpose may be
       required.
